JBoss BPM Suite Vacation Request Demo
=====================================
This is a simple vacation request process project for employees to request PTO / Vacation days. It demonstrates the following
functionality:

- Rest service (GET & POST)

- Human Task assignment and escalation

- Business Rule for auto approval

This is a vacation process example which calls out to a REST service to get vacation information based on a 
particular ID. Based on the rule for hours requested (10 hours or less), the request is auto approved or is 
routed to a manager. When the manager claims but does not complete the task in 30 seconds, it's automatically
returned to the group. Once approved or not approved, the original requester can see the status.
